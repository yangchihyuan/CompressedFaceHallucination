%05/25/2016 I create this function to apply SA-DCT deblocking algorithm on
%test and compared images of our compressed face hallucination project. The
%source code is copied from demo_SADCT_deblocking.m belonging the
%SA_DCT_Demobox_v143.


function img_output = F55_SADCT_deblock( fn_input_JPEG_file )

% Pointwise Shape-Adaptive DCT deblocking of Block-DCT compressed images (e.g. JPEG) (using low-complexity SA-DCT)
%
% Alessandro Foi - Tampere University of Technology - 2005 - 2016   Public release v1.43 (15 May 2016)   C-code implementation by Kostadin Dabov
% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
%
%  IMPORTANT VARIABLES:
%
%  yRGB         :  original image (if available) in RGB space
%  zRGB         :  B-DCT domain compressed image (observation) in RGB space
%  yRGB_hat     :  Pointwise SA-DCT final estimate in RGB space (final estimate, obtained from yLumChrom_hat_wi or yLumChrom_hat)
%  yLumChrom         :  original image (if available) in luminance-chrominance space (YUV)
%  zLumChrom         :  B-DCT domain compressed image (observation) in luminance-chrominance space (YUV)
%  yLumChrom_hat     :  hard-thresholding estimate in luminance-chrominance space (YUV)
%  yLumChrom_hat_wi  :  Wiener-filter estimate in luminance-chrominance space (YUV) (final estimate, obtained using yLumChrom_hat as reference estimate in Wiener-filtering)
%  h_opt_Q   :  array with the adaptive-scale indexes for the kernels used in the construction of the adaptive-shape transform support
%
%     Note:  if input image is grayscale it is used for the luminance channel Y and no RGB variables are used.
%
%
% The code implements the algorithm and reproduces the results published in:
